# OTGI App

This is an extremely simple IOS app to provide real-time diagnostics information via the [OTGI](https://www.github.com/jwjbadger/OTGI) project. It tracks fuel usage across multiple trips and uses this to provide an accurate estimate of the remaining fuel and range of the vehicle. More detail is provided in the OTGI README.

As this is was quickly hacked together to simply display the information, I would like to caution that it may be updated at any time with breaking changes.
